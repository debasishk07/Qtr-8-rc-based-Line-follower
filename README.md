# Qtr-8-rc-based-Line-follower
This is our advanced PID algorithm based Line follower which has participated in many events and secured many positions. I will be uploading it's updates and working information here.


Put the QTRSensors.h and the workingOne.ino file in the same folder and then compile.
If you find any error or missing library then install the necessary libraries.

I will be soon uploading the circuit diagrams and our event participation test runs.
